This is a controller configuration for the [Mixxx DJing software](https://mixxx.org/) to use the Novation Launchpad Mini MK2 as a way to control samplers.

![novation launchpad mini - KEYS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428cc27b-ce3e-45d4-975c-2cb559cf3304)

It is designed to control 8 samplers, and allow play/stop, use the first 4 hotcues (1, 2, 3 and 4) as well as volume down/up for each sampler. Lastly, it allows to syncronize the BMP with the current playing file in a simple way.

As it is limited to samplers, it is primarily designed to complete a DJ Controller (and not replace it)
