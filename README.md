This is a controller configuration for the Mixxx DJing software to use the Novation Launchpad Mini MK2 as a way to control samplers.

It is designed to control 8 samplers, and allow play/stop, use the first 4 hotcues (1, 2, 3 and 4) as well as volume down/up for each sampler. Lastly, it allows to syncronize the BMP with the current playing file in a simple way.
